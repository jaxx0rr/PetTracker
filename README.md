## 🧪 How to Use

1. **Craft the Pet Tracker:** place an emerald over a stick in the crafting grid.
2. **Right-click a pet** to manually add it to the tracker. These will appear in **gray**.
3. Use the in-game buttons:
   - **[Area Scan]** to add all nearby pets (owned and unowned). These will show in **red** 🔴.
   - **[Loaded Chunks]** to include all pets from currently loaded chunks. These appear in **blue** 🔵.
   - **[Deep Scan]** to include pets from unloaded chunks in a radius. Slow, but no server lag (can cause chunk generation). **Black icons** ⚫.
   - **[Fast Scan]** does the same as Deep Scan, but it's much faster and more demanding on the server. Also **Black icons** ⚫.
